# Graphs in Python

This is an implementation of a directed graph ADT in Python. The graph is represented by an adjacency list, and supports the following actions.


* adding a vertex
* adding an edge
* removing an edge
* removing a vertex
* get all adjacent vertices for a given vertex
* get all incident edges for a given vertex
* get all the vertices of the graph
* get all the edges of the graph
* get a specific edge
